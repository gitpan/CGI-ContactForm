NAME
    CGI::ContactForm - Perl extension for generating a web contact form

SYNOPSIS
        use CGI::ContactForm;

        contactform (
            recname        => 'John Smith',
            recmail        => 'john.smith@domain.com',
            smtp           => 'smtp.domain.com',
            styleurl       => '/style/ContactForm.css',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a contact form for the web when the routine
    "contactform()" is called from a CGI script. Arguments are passed to the
    module as a list of key/value pairs.

    "CGI::ContactForm" sends a well formated (plain text format=flowed in
    accordance with RFC 2646) email message, with the sender's address in
    the "From:" header, and the sender gets a "bcc" copy. If the email
    address stated by the sender is invalid, the failure message is sent to
    the recipient address, through which you know that you don't need to
    bother with a reply, at least not to that address...

INSTALLATION
  Installation with Makefile.PL

    Type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

  Manual Installation

    *   Download the distribution file and extract the contents.

    *   Designate a directory as your local library for Perl modules, for
        instance

            /www/username/cgi-bin/lib

    *   Create the directory "/www/username/cgi-bin/lib/CGI", and upload
        "ContactForm.pm" to that directory.

    *   In the CGI scripts that use this module, include a line that tells
        Perl to look for modules also in your local library, such as

            use lib '/www/username/cgi-bin/lib';

DEPENDENCIES
    "CGI::ContactForm" requires these modules, available at CPAN:

        Mail::Sender
        Text::Flowed

    It also requires direct access to an SMTP server.

    If "Mail::Sender" and "Text::Flowed" need to be installed manually, you
    shall create "/www/username/cgi-bin/lib/Mail" and
    "/www/username/cgi-bin/lib/Text" and upload "Sender.pm" respective
    "Flowed.pm" to those directories.

EXAMPLES
    An example CGI script ("contact.pl") and a style sheet
    ("ContactForm.css") are included in the distribution. Note that the
    style sheet typically needs to be located somewhere outside the cgi-bin.
