NAME
    CGI::ContactForm - Perl extension for generating a web contact form

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use lib '/path/to/lib';  (For the case this module, or any
                                  module it's dependent on, is installed
                                  in a local library.)
        use CGI::ContactForm;

        contactform (
            recname        => 'John Smith',              \
            recmail        => 'john.smith@domain.com',    } Compulsory
            smtp           => 'smtp.domain.com',         /

            styleurl       => '/style/ContactForm.css',  \
            returnlinktext => 'Back',                     } Optional
            returnlinkurl  => '/some/url',               /
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a contact form for the web when the routine
    "contactform()" is called from a CGI script. The CGI script shall
    consist of just a few lines of code like in the example under SYNOPSIS
    above. The arguments are passed to the module as a list of key/value
    pairs.

    "CGI::ContactForm" sends a well formated (plain text format=flowed in
    accordance with RFC 2646) email message, with the sender's address in
    the "From:" header, and the sender gets a "bcc" copy. If the email
    address stated by the sender is invalid, the failure message is sent to
    the recipient address, through which you know that you don't need to
    bother with a reply, at least not to that address...

INSTALLATION
  Installation with Makefile.PL

    Type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

  Manual Installation

    *   Download and extract the distribution file.

    *   Designate a directory as your local library for Perl modules, for
        instance

            /cgi-bin/lib

    *   Create the directory "/cgi-bin/lib/CGI", and upload "ContactForm.pm"
        to that directory.

    If "Mail::Sender" and "Text::Flowed" (see DEPENDENCIES below) need to be
    installed manually, you shall create "/cgi-bin/lib/Mail" and
    "/cgi-bin/lib/Text" and upload "Sender.pm" respective "Flowed.pm" to
    those directories.

DEPENDENCIES
    "CGI::ContactForm" requires these modules, available at CPAN:

        Mail::Sender
        Text::Flowed

    It also requires direct access to an SMTP server.

EXAMPLES
    An example CGI script ("contact.pl") and a style sheet
    ("ContactForm.css") are included in the distribution.
